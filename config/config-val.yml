# Oasis Node Configuration
#
# This file's contents are derived from the command line arguments found in the
# root command of the oasis-node binary. For more information, execute:
#
#     oasis-node --help
#
# Settings on the command line that are separated by a dot all belong to the
# same nested object. For example, "--foo.bar.baz hello" would translate to:
#
#     foo:
#       bar:
#         baz: hello
